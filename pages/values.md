# Values

Inspired by the work I did writing about <a href="/blog/luck-skill-and-effort/">luck, skill, and effort</a> here's an incomplete, yet accurate list of my current values:

1. **Autonomy** – It's important to me to do what I want, when and where I want to, according to my level of motivation. I think there are some deep rooted beliefs at play that have their own benefits and tradeoffs. 
2. **Calm** - Over the past few years I’ve grown to value calm. In the work I continue to do to learn to “let go” and not try to figure everything out, calm has become a new high priority value.
3. **Learning** – From an early age, I was in an environment that cultivated curiosity.  I love learning new things and have developed an increasing comfort with the discomfort associated with being a beginner.
4. **Solving Problems** – I love figuring things out. This at the heart of <a href="/games/">my love for games</a>, why my interest in a game quickly fizzles when it’s “solved”, and why I keep coming back to favorites. 
5. **Relationships** – I did not grow up with healthy attachments. Thanks to therapy, hard work, a lot of growth through pain, and people who love me, relationships have moved up to become something I now value.
