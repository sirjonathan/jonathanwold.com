# Games

Games are an important part of my life and work. I make time for games daily and enjoy them as a way to practice <a href="https://jonathanwold.com/luck-skill-and-effort/#values">my personal values</a>. 

Games I currently enjoy playing the most:

* <a href="https://polytopia.io/">Polytopia</a> - A turn-based strategy game I play with friends.
* <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/">Brawl Stars</a> - An arena game I play with our kids.
* <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/">Clash of Clans</a> - A semi-guilty pleasure.

Games I enjoy watching and sometimes playing:

* Starcraft 2 - Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WinterStarcraft">WinterGaming on YouTube</a>.
* Age of Empires - Thanks to my deep love for the series and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@T90Official">T90 on YouTube</a>.

And, a couple of times per year, I love Twilight Imperium with friends.
