# Now
 

After several <a href="/blog/loss-and-sorrow/">especially difficult years</a>, I am doing well, living out <a href="/values/">my values</a>.

My business focus now includes:

* <a href="https://guildenberg.com">Guildenberg</a> - Ongoing investment in the WordPress ecosystem.
* <a href="http://prettygood.fm">Pretty Good Podcasts</a> - Creating <a href="https://crossword.fm">Crossword</a> and growing the network.
* <a href="https://bluevineyard.com">Blue Vineyard</a> - A long-term investment in the Adventist ecosystem.
* <a href="https://bloomandbuild.kids">Bloom and Build</a> - Supporting Amanda's education and childcare foray.
* Lexomatic - A legal-tech focused startup with friends.

Beyond that, I'm reading regularly, <a href="/games/">playing games</a>, enjoying time with <a href="https://amandamacumber.me/">Amanda</a> and our kids, and doing what I enjoy, including working on this website now and then.

I've also re-enrolled in college after a 20 year hiatus and am working my way towards an MBA, with a finance emphasis.
