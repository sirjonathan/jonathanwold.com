Hi there! ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™ve enjoyed nearly 40 rotations around the sun and still feel like a kid most days. Iâ€™ve been curious and confident (sometimes overly so) <a href="/about">since I crawled out of my crib</a>â€”creating, communicating, connecting, and learning to collaborate.

Most of <a href="/now">my time these days</a> is spent investing in businesses, particularly <a href="https://guildenberg.com">in the WordPress ecosystem</a>. I also <a href="/podcasts">podcast regularly</a>, write <a href="/blog/">from time to time</a>, expand my backlog of reading, enjoy time with friends, learn new skills, and <a href="/games">play my favorite games</a>.

I <a href="/colophon">built this website myself</a> and Iâ€™d love to see what youâ€™re building! <a href="/contact">Contact me anytime</a> and show me what youâ€™re working on.

Thanks for sharing your time with me.
