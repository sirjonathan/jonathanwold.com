# About

I was born June 9, 1986 to Marty and Renette Wold, just outside of Nashville, Tennessee. They had 2 more boys, Joshua and Josiah, before dad passed away in '91. Mom homeschooled us and instilled entrepreneurial values. At 18 I left home to start my own journey, certain I'd be a millionaire by 20.

The next 18 years felt, in my then optimistic view, like moving from success to success. I started multiple businesses. I married, had two children, moved across the country, bought, built, and sold multiple homes - always striving for more. It turned out, though, that I was just surviving. Within a few short years, I experienced <a href="/blog/loss-and-sorrow/">deep loss and sorrow</a>, ending that period of my life divorced, bankrupt, and broken.

In the years since, I've been healing and rebuilding, leading to <a href="/now/">the work I'm doing now</a>, living out <a href="/values/">my values</a>. I am a semi-practicing Seventh-day Adventist and while I have more questions than answers, I consider faith to be an important part of my life experience.
