# Colophon

The "golden ratio" design is something I first attempted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061205042655/http://jonathanwold.com/">back in 2006</a> and then re-attempted now, inspired by <a href="https://codepen.io/bobby1030/pen/EWmyZW">this example on codepen</a>.

The tools and resources I used included:

* Nova - My current code-editor of choice on the Mac.
* ChatGPT - For numerous questions about CSS.
* GitHub - For keeping track of my codebase.
* Eleventy - For static site generating. 
* CloudFlare - Hosting via CloudFlare Pages. 
* BigScoots - Hosting for my WordPress blog.

My fonts are EB Garamond, Jost, and Open Sans, served up by Bunny.net.
