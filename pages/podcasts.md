# Podcasts

Podcasting has been a part of my life for the past 5+ years and remains something I enjoy and prioritize. Most of my efforts these days are focused on growing the <a href="https://prettygood.fm">Pretty Good Podcast Network</a> and the two podcasts I co-host, <a href="https://crossword.fm">Crossword</a> and <a href="https://woldwideweb.fm">Wold Wide Web</a>.

I'm also a co-host on <a href="https://openchannels.fm/">Open Channels</a>.

Want to have me as a guest on a podcast?<a href="/contact/">Contact me</a>.
